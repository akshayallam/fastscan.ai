# fastscan.ai
A quick and dirty way to instantly diagnose all stages of skin cancer simply with the snap of a photo.

Neural network model trained to instantly diagnose all stages of skin cancer simply with the snap of a photo.
● Trained the image classifier model using the fastai deep learning library and a large dataset of skin cancer images
● Created a web server with Python and Flask to communicate between the neural network and Twilio API
● Allowed the user to send a picture of their skin and receive a quick diagnosis via SMS

Dataset for training the model can be found in the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Courses.
